🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to detect faces, recognize emotions, and identify body positions from images or videos. Leveraging advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system can analyze and interpret human expressions and body language in real-time or from pre-recorded media.

📋 Features
Face Detection:
Accurately detects human faces in images or videos.
Supports multiple faces in a single frame.
😊
Emotion Recognition:

Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.
Provides probability scores for each detected emotion.

👨‍💼👩‍💼
Body Detection:

Detects and maps key points on the human body (e.g., head, shoulders, arms, legs).
Provides pose estimation for activity tracking.

Real-Time Processing:

Processes live video streams for real-time analysis.
Optimized for webcam and video input.
📂 Project Structure
/models: Pretrained deep learning models for face, emotion, and body detection.
/data: Sample images and videos for testing.
/src: Core implementation scripts.
/outputs: Processed results, including annotated images and analysis logs.
